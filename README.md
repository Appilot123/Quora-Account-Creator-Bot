<h1 align="center">Quora Account Creator Bot</h1>

## Project Overview:

This project automates the creation of Quora accounts using custom-domain business emails and a stealth browser environment. It targets bulk account generation with IMAP-based email verification, CAPTCHA solving, and human-like behavior simulation to avoid detection. Built for marketers, researchers, and automation specialists, this bot is ideal for scaling Quora presence while navigating platform restrictions.

The core challenge tackled here is Quoraâ€™s sensitivity to bulk signups and detection of automation. By integrating rotating proxies, CAPTCHA solving services, and IMAP email handling, this solution ensures streamlined, low-footprint account creation.

## Core Features:
- **Stealth Automation:** Mimics human interaction via random delays, mouse movements, and dynamic fingerprinting.
- **Email Verification via IMAP:** Pulls OTPs directly from unlimited business emails using secure IMAP access.
- **CAPTCHA Bypass Support:** Integrates third-party CAPTCHA APIs to automate puzzle-solving during account setup.
